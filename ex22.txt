input() - Asking user for input and then using it in your program.

from * import * - Telling python to find a code library and import a module from that library to our code. This allows us to use already established code in our program.

*.read() - reads the file passed where * is. Prints it to the console.

*.close() - closes the file passed where * is.

open() - opens the file passed to it.

*.write() - writes the content inside the Parantheses to the target file or variable.

*.seek() - moves through a given file. ex:
    file.seek(0) - will move to the beginning of a file
    file.seek(1) - will stay at the current part of the file.
    file.seek(2) - will move to the end of the file.

*.readline() - Reads the file until a new line is reached or the end of the file is reached.

def - begins the creation of a function that can be reused by calling the given name of that function. Normal syntax in python is:
    def funcname(parameter_list):
    pass

: - used in defining functions and loops. Any other code inside the function must now be indented 4 spaces. Code not indented will be run as seperate from the function or loop.

return - returns a value to the function, but does not print it to the stream.
